→ htm + numbering




file:///media/ivan/b80419af-a8d6-45d8-a9e8-6cc218a53241/geobithash/resources/524534.pdf
→ oqtm + healpix





file:///media/ivan/b80419af-a8d6-45d8-a9e8-6cc218a53241/geobithash/resources/gdggs98.pdf
→ more ways to divide triangles than expected at first, hexagons





- This is a weekend project
- I'm doing this for fun
- I have no idea about geodesy

→ area deviation from the median



file:///media/ivan/b80419af-a8d6-45d8-a9e8-6cc218a53241/geobithash/resources/geodesicmath.pdf → great circles & splitting triangles



- Stuff on the surface of a sphere is hard
- Stuff on the surface of a geoid is harder
- Then floating point comes along and makes your life impossible



Decisions, decisions
- Trixels, hexels
- Geodesy
- Floating point math
- Equal area
- Great circles
- Easy to code



One more thing: 
- Patents :-(

https://github.com/r-barnes/dggridR/ → R only


Tips for successful geospatial software:
→ License file
→ Let yourself be known to OSGeo
→ Don't stop at the academic paper
→ Don't stop at the business use case
